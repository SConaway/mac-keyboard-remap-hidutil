# mac-keyboard-remap-hidutil

Small Python Script to ensure that hidutil always has a key remapping for an external keyboard

Included is a sample `.plist` for launchctl that I use. you can generate your own at the wonderful (`hidutil-generator` by `amarsyla`)[https://hidutil-generator.netlify.app/]. I based mine off of one generated by that wonderful tool. The `.plist` should be in your `LaunchAgents` directory: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`

For the python script, you will need to modify:

1. the `product_ID`. To find it, open System Information, click USB in the sidebar, click on your device, and find the Product ID
2. the `plist_name`. I'd stick to something like the filename of mine, but feel free to change it.
