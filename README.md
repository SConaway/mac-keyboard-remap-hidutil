# mac-keyboard-remap-hidutil

Small Python Script to ensure that hidutil always has a key remapping for an external keyboard

Included is a sample `.plist` for launchctl that I use. you can generate your own at the wonderful [`hidutil-generator` by `amarsyla`](https://hidutil-generator.netlify.app). I based mine off of one generated by that wonderful tool. The `.plist` should be in your `LaunchAgents` directory: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`

For the python script, you will need to modify:

1. the `product_ID`. To find it, open System Information, click USB in the sidebar, click on your device, and find the Product ID
2. the `plist_name`. I'd stick to something like the filename of mine, but feel free to change it.

## To install

1. copy `me.stevenconaway.KeyRemapping.plist` to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` (or install one generated by `hidutil-generator`, but make sure to correct file paths as needed in the commands below and in `me.stevenconaway.KeyRemappingScript.plist`)
2. ensure it's set up correctly by running `launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.stevenconaway.KeyRemapping.plist`; this should set up your keyboard the way you want.
3. copy `me.stevenconaway.KeyRemapping.plist` to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
4. run `launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.stevenconaway.KeyRemappingScript.plist` to enable and start the script.
5. it should work!
